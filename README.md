# AirBnB Clone - Command Interpreter

## Project Description
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This is the first step towards building a full web application that replicates the core functionalities of the AirBnB website. In this phase, we have developed a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects, which will be used in subsequent projects involving HTML/CSS templating, database storage, APIs, and front-end integration.

## Command Interpreter Description

### How to Start It
To start the command interpreter, run the `console.py` file in your terminal:
```bash
$ ./console.py

## Usage ðŸ’»

The console works both in interactive mode and non-interactive mode, much like a Unix shell.
It prints a prompt **(hbnb)** and waits for the user for input.

Command | Example
------- | -------
Run the console | ```./console.py```
Quit the console | ```(hbnb) quit```
Display the help for a command | ```(hbnb) help <command>```
Create an object (prints its id)| ```(hbnb) create <class>```
Show an object | ```(hbnb) show <class> <id>``` or ```(hbnb) <class>.show(<id>)```
Destroy an object | ```(hbnb) destroy <class> <id>``` or ```(hbnb) <class>.destroy(<id>)```
Show all objects, or all instances of a class | ```(hbnb) all``` or ```(hbnb) all <class>```
Update an attribute of an object | ```(hbnb) update <class> <id> <attribute name> "<attribute value>"``` or ```(hbnb) <class>.update(<id>, <attribute name>, "<attribute value>")```
